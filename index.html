    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Chethan Jayashankar, completed my Master’s in Data Science at Coventry University. My journey into data started with curiosity, the idea that numbers and patterns can reveal powerful stories about people, systems, and decisions.
Over time, I’ve worked on projects ranging from healthcare analytics, like predicting hyperglycaemia risk in diabetic patients, to financial fraud detection and natural language processing. What excites me most is using data not just to build models, but to solve meaningful problems that have real-world impact.
I enjoy combining technical skills of Python, machine learning, deep learning, and SQL  with a problem-solving mindset. Whether it’s cleaning messy datasets, building predictive models, or creating interactive apps, I see data science as both an art and a science.
Outside academics, I’m fascinated by entrepreneurship, technology-driven businesses, and exploring how AI can be applied in everyday life. I’m also working towards building a data-driven business that combines my passion for analytics with long-term financial independence.
When I’m not working with data, you’ll usually find me boxing (it teaches me discipline and resilience), reading about startups and personal finance, or exploring new places around the UK. These interests give me balance — they keep me sharp, curious, and grounded, both as a person and as a professional.
My goal is simple: to grow as a data scientist who not only understands algorithms, but also how to apply them responsibly, ethically, and effectively.
